<h1 class="no_toc" id="significance-the-students-t-test-and-p-values"><em>Significance: The Student’s t-test and p-values</em></h1>

<h2 id="p-value-definition">p-value: definition</h2>

<p>You have a hypothesis \(H_1\), usually <em>complicated</em>, that you suspect
may explain your experimental observations, and a null hypothesis
\(H_0\), usually simpler, that could also explain your results.</p>

<p>A new result comes in for which you \(H_1\) hypothesis assigns a
particular “score” \(= sc\).</p>

<p>The p-value of \(sc\) is the <strong>cumulative probability</strong> that using the
<strong>null hypothesis</strong> you could have got that score or higher (assuming that
higher score is better).</p>

\[\mbox{pvalue}(sc) = P(\mbox{score} &gt;= sc \mid H_0).\]

<p>If \(\mbox{p-value}(sc)\) is small, that means there is little chance
of that score being obtained under the null model. A common mistake is
to think that such a small p-value implies that your hypothesis \(H_1\)
is true. <strong>A p-value says nothing about your hypothesis, but about the
hypothesis you would like to reject.</strong> Rejecting the null hypothesis
does not imply that your hypothesis is true.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example:</h2>

<p>Remember the homework where you where running a new experiment which
for a previous researcher had a failure frequency of \(f^0= 0.2\), and
you observed ‘ssfff’, that is, a sequence of 2 successes (s) followed
by three failures (f) ?</p>

<p>We can introduce two hypotheses</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>\(H_0\):</strong> The failure frequency \(f\) is equal to \(f^0\) (\(f = 0.20\)).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>\(H_1\):</strong> The failure frequency \(f\) is larger than \(f^0\) (\(f &gt; 0.20\)).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-p-value-approach">The p-value approach</h3>

<p><em>We can calculate what is the probability under the null hypothesis
of obtaining in 5 attempts the observed result or something more
extreme.</em></p>

<p>Those events are: ‘ssfff’, ‘sffff’, and ‘fffff’. Resulting in a
p-value,</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
pval(\mbox{'ssfff'})
&amp;= P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid H_0) +P(\mbox{'sffff'}\mid H_0) +P(\mbox{'fffff'}\mid H_0)\\
&amp;= \frac{5!}{3!2!} 0.2^3 0.8^2 + \frac{5!}{4!1!} 0.2^4 0.8 + \frac{5!}{5!0!} 0.2^5 \\
&amp;= 0.0512 + 0.0064 + 0.00032\\
&amp;= 0.05792
\end{aligned}\]

<p><strong>What would you do with this result?</strong></p>

<p>Oftentimes, a p-value is used to “reject” the null hypothesis if the
pvalue is smaller than \(0.05\). Would you or would you not reject the
null hypothesis after this result?  Why 0.05?</p>

<h3 id="the-bayesian-approach">The Bayesian approach</h3>

<p>We have learned to calculate the posterior probability \(P(f \mid
\mbox{'ssfff'})\) which tell us a lot about the value of the failure
parameter \(f\) given the data. Namely,</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
P(f \mid \mbox{‘ssfff’}) =
\frac{6!}{3! 2!}\, f^3 (1-f)^2,
\end{equation}</p>

<p>which is given in Figure 1. The maximum of this posterior distribution
is \(f^* = 0.6\), far away from the failure frequency \(f^0 = 0.2\) of
the null hypothesis.</p>

<div id="figcontainer">
  <div id="figure">
    <img src="Figure1.png" style="width:300px;" /> <br />
    Figure 1. Posterior probabilities of the
  frequency of failure given that you have obtained 2 successes and 3
  failures.
  </div>
</div>

<p>Bayesian hypothesis comparison tells us</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{P(H_0\mid \mbox{'ssfff'})}{P(H_1\mid \mbox{'ssfff'})}
&amp;=
\frac{P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid H_0)\,P(H_0)}
     {P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid H_1)\,P(H_1)}.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Let us assume that both hypotheses are equally likely \(P(H_0) =
P(H_1)\). Then the ratio of the two hypotheses is the ratio of the
evidences of the data given \(H_0\) and \(H_1\), as</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{P(H_0\mid \mbox{'ssfff'})}{P(H_1\mid \mbox{'ssfff'})}
&amp;=
\frac{P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid H_0)}{P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid H_1)}.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>And using marginalization,</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid H_0)}{P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid H_1)}
&amp;=
\frac{\int_{0}^{1} P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid f, H_0)\,P(f\mid H_0)\, df}
{\int_{0}^{1} P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid f, H_1)\,P(f\mid H_1)\, df}.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Let’s assume that for the \(H_0\) hypothesis the probability does not
have to be <em>precisely</em> \(f^0\), but it can take the range \(f^0\pm
0.01\).</p>

<p>Using uniform priors</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
P(f\mid H_0) &amp;= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{1}{0.21-0.19}  &amp; \mbox{for}\quad 0.19 &lt; f &lt; 0.21\\
0                    &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.\\
P(f\mid H_1) &amp;= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{1}{1.0-0.2} &amp; \mbox{for}\quad 0.2 &lt; f &lt; 1\\
0                 &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>we have</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{P(H_0\mid \mbox{'ssfff'})}{P(H_1\mid \mbox{'ssfff'})}
=
\frac{P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid H_0)}{P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid H_1)}
&amp;=
\frac{\int_{0}^{1} P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid f)\,P(f\mid H_0)\,df}{\int_{0}^{1} P(\mbox{'ssfff'}\mid f)\,P(f\mid H_1)\, df}\\
&amp;=
\frac{\frac{1}{0.02}\,\int_{0.19}^{0.21} f^3 (1-f)^2 \,df}{\frac{1}{0.80}\,\int_{0.2}^{1} f^3 (1-f)^2 \,df}\\
&amp;=
\frac{\frac{1}{0.02}\,\left[\frac{1}{4}f^4+\frac{1}{6}f^6-\frac{2}{5}f^5\right]^{0.21}_{0.19}}
{\frac{1}{0.80}\,\left[\frac{1}{4}f^4+\frac{1}{6}f^6-\frac{2}{5}f^5\right]^{1}_{0.20}}\\
&amp;=
\frac{0.005127}{0.020480}\\
&amp;=
\frac{20.02}{79.98}
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Thus, given the data and our priors, there is a 80:20 chance that the
failure probability is larger than 0.2.</p>

<h3 id="which-method-do-you-prefer">Which method do you prefer?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As you can see in this example, the p-value does not use any information about the
\(H_1\) hypothesis, thus does not provide any information about
\(H_1\), while the Bayesian method does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculating a p-value can be easier, especially for methods with many
parameters, and you should feel free to use it, provided that you
know what you are doing, and interpret the results correctly.  The
above p-value of \(\sim\)0.06 does not mean that the probability of
the null hypothesis being false is 94%, it is just the probability
of obtaining the results you got under the null hypothesis.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it is difficult to decide what to do with a given p-value result.
More about this later in this lecture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, if possible, the Bayesian method is preferable as it
conveys a lot more information. Just the posterior probability (Figure
1) gives you a lot of information about what the data tells about the
value of the parameters. It is also more robust to small fluctuations
as allowing you integrate around the value 0.2 for \(H_0\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-students-t-test-a-widely-used-p-value">The Student’s t-test: a widely used p-value</h2>

<p>It is typical to provide a p-value to compare the mean of a
experimental distribution to a known mean of a null hypothesis. Let’s
consider one practical case.</p>

<div id="figcontainer">
  <div id="figure">
    <img src="RNaseP.png" style="width:300px;" /> <br />
  </div>
</div>

<p>There are genes that do not produce proteins, but the functional
product is the RNA molecule. Many of those functional RNAs form stable
structures.  RNaseP RNA is an example of a structural RNA that
functions as a ribozyme (a RNA enzyme).  RNaseP RNA is responsible for
trimming the ends of tRNAs. As many other functional RNAs, RNAseP RNA
has a structure.</p>

<p>Finding the structure of one of those functional RNAs is an
interesting problem. One conclusive way is using crystallography, but
that is hard and slow. We have faster computational methods that can
predict structures given the RNA sequence.  There are also
experimental techniques (named RNA structural or chemical probing)
that given an RNA molecule, can calculate the reactivity of each
residue for rather long RNA molecules. These chemical reactivities
correlate with the flexibility of the RNA molecule, thus they are
expected to inform us about which residues are paired and unpaired in
the molecule, thus providing experimental information about RNA
structure (<a href="2006_kw_nprot.pdf">see for instance</a>).</p>

<p>I have taken chemical probing data for a well known RNA molecule,
RNaseP RNA, from the RNA Mapping DataBase
([RMDB])(https://rmdb.stanford.edu/), a repository of RNA structure
probing. <a href="RNASEP_DMS_0000.rdat">Here</a> is the original data if you want
to double check my analysis (which I encourage you to do). And here
are the files extracted from the previous file of <a href="RNASEP_DMS_0000.rdat.outp">reactivities for
bases that are paired</a>, and <a href="RNASEP_DMS_0000.rdat.outu">reactivities
for bases that are not paired</a>, for the
wild type RNaseP RNA sequence.</p>

<div id="figcontainer">
  <div id="figure">
    <img src="shape_box.png" style="width:300px;" /> <br />
    Figure 3. Mean and standard deviation
    for the reactivity data of one chemical probing experiment for RNaseP RNA.
  </div>
</div>

<p>In Figure 3, I show a typical plot. As you well know, I do not like those
plots, and I think you should never use them. This plots simply tells us
what the mean and standard deviation of the reactivities are if we separate
the base paired residues from those that are unpaired.</p>

<p>Another typical thing to do is to add a mysterious p-value associated
to that plot. I have followed that trend. Let the null hypothesis be
that a residue is unpaired. One such typical method is called
<strong>Student’s t-test</strong>.  I have used a Python function that implements
the Student’s t-test, named
<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html"><strong>ttest_ind</strong></a>.  I have
used the ttest matlab function out of the box in order to calculate
the p-value of the distribution of paired residues relative to that of
unpaired residues (the null hypothesis).</p>

<p>The <strong>ttest</strong> function assigns a p-value of \(4.6e^{-9}\) for the
paired residue distribution to have the mean of the unpaired residue
distribution.</p>

<p>From this small p-value, you <em>may</em> be tempted to conclude that clearly
you can use chemical probing data to distinguish between residues are
paired from those that are not, thus to infer a structure for the RNA.</p>

<p><strong>That conclusion would be wrong</strong></p>

<p>If you go to the matlab documentation for the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/ttest.html"><strong>ttest</strong>
function</a>, the first
thing you read is that in order to use the Student’s t-test, the
distribution of the data <strong>has to be Gaussian</strong> (see Figure 3).
However, if you go to the Python documentation, they don’t even bother
mentioning that fact. It is only when you go to the linked wikipedia
pages.</p>

<p>Is that the case for this data?</p>

<p>Figure 4 shows that the distributions of reactivity scores both for
paired and unpaired residues are obviously not Gaussian.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-the-students-distribution-have-to-do-with-any-of-this">What does the Student’s distribution have to do with any of this?</h3>

<p>For this section, I am following Sivia’s book “Data Analysis”,
Sections 2.3 and 3.2.</p>

<p>Let us be Bayesian again. We have an experiments in which the
measurements \(\{x_k\}\) are Gaussian. The <em>ttest</em> calculates the
probability that the experiment’s mean could have come from a process
of mean \(\mu\).</p>

<p>Bayes’ theorem tells us that the posterior probability for the two
parameters of the Gaussian distribution \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) is given
by</p>

\[\begin{equation}
P(\mu, \sigma\mid \{x_k\}, I)
\propto P(\{x_k\}\mid \mu, \sigma, I) \times P(\mu, \sigma\mid I),
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(P(\mu, \sigma\mid I)\) is the prior probability of the
parameters.</p>

<p>Since we are comparing only means, the Bayesian thing to do is to integrate to all
possible values of the variance \(\sigma\)</p>

\[\begin{equation}
P(\mu\mid \{x_k\}, I)
\propto \int_0^{\infty} P(\{x_k\}\mid \mu, \sigma, I) \times P(\mu, \sigma\mid I)\, d\sigma.
\end{equation}\]

<p>The probability of the data given \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) is</p>

\[\begin{equation}
P(\{x_k\}\mid \mu, \sigma, I)
= \prod_k P(x_k\mid \mu, \sigma, I)
= \frac{1}{\left(\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}\right)^N} \mbox{exp}\left[ -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{k=1}^N(x_k-\mu)^2\right].
\end{equation}\]

<p>Assuming uninformative and independent priors</p>

\[P(\mu, \sigma\mid  I) = P(\mu\mid  I)\, P(\sigma\mid  I)\]

<p>where</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
P(\mu\mid  I) &amp;= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{1}{\mu_{+}-\mu_{-}}  &amp; \mbox{for}\quad \mu_{-} &lt; \mu &lt; \mu_{+}\\
0                          &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.\\
P(\sigma\mid  I) &amp;= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\mbox{constant} &amp; \mbox{for}\quad \sigma &gt; 0\\
0                 &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>are constants, which allows us to include the prior in the
proportionality.</p>

<p>The posterior probability of \(\mu\) is then</p>

\[\begin{equation}
P(\mu\mid \{x_k\}, I)
\propto
 \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sigma^N} \mbox{exp}\left[ -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{k=1}^N(x_k-\mu)^2\right]\, d\sigma.
\end{equation}\]

<p>Introducing a change of variable</p>

\[t = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_k (x_k-\mu)^2}}{\sigma}\quad \mbox{then}\quad d\sigma = -\frac{\sqrt{\sum_k (x_k-\mu)^2}}{t^2}\, dt\]

<p>we obtain,</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
P(\mu\mid \{x_k\}, I)
&amp;\propto
\int_0^{\infty} \left(\frac{t}{\sqrt{\sum_k (x_k-\mu)^2}}\right)^N \left(e^{-t^2/2}\right)\ \frac{\sqrt{\sum_k (x_k-\mu)^2}}{t^2}\, dt\\
&amp;=
\left(\sqrt{\sum_k (x_k-\mu)^2}\right)^{-N+1} \int_0^{\infty} t^{N-2} e^{-t^2/2} dt.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Then, since the integral is a constant that does not depend on  the data or \(\mu\),</p>

\[\begin{equation}
P(\mu\mid \{x_k\}, I)
\propto
 \left(\sum_k (x_k-\mu)^2\right)^{\frac{-N+1}{2}}.
\end{equation}\]

<p>Introducing the sample mean \(\bar x = \frac{1}{N}\sum_k x_k\), and using the identity</p>

\[\sum_k (x_k-\mu)^2 = N\left(\bar x - \mu\right)^2 + \sum_k\left(x_k-\bar x\right)^2,\]

<p>and introducing \(V\equiv \sum_k\left(x_k-\bar x\right)^2\) which is
not dependent on \(\mu\)</p>

<p>we have,</p>

\[\begin{equation}
P(\mu\mid \{x_k\}, I)
\propto
 \left[N (\bar x-\mu)^2 + V\right]^{\frac{-N+1}{2}},
\end{equation}\]

<p>which is one of many representations of the Student’s t distribution.</p>

    Figure 5. Comparison of the Student's t distribution for a zero sample mean and
    different values of N to the Gaussian distribution of mean zero and sigma one.
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Student’s distribution is much like the Gaussian distribution. It
is symmetric around \(\mu\). The main difference from a Gaussian is
that the tails are much fatter and they extend further from the mean
value. As \(N\) becomes larger, the Student’s t distribution becomes
closer to the Gaussian distribution. (See Figure 5).</p>

<h3 id="is-this-p-value-what-you-really-want-to-know">Is this p-value what you really want to know?</h3>

<p>Student’s t-test or not, it is obvious that the means of the two
chemical probing distributions for paired and unpaired residues are
different (Figure 4). For some experiments, knowing that the means are
different is all you need.  But let us think again about what we would
like to achieve here.  You want to see if chemical probing
reactivities will help you distinguish residues that are base paired
from those that are not paired.</p>

<p>The p-value calculation you would like to do is:</p>

<p><strong>for a given
reactivity value, what is the probability that I could have obtained
that reactivity or smaller if the residue were unpaired?</strong></p>

<p>We can calculate an empirical version of this p-value using the data
we have.  From the distribution of unpaired residues in Figure 4, I
find</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><em>reactivity</em></th>
      <th><em>p-value</em></th>
      <th><em>unpaired residues with this reactivity or lower</em></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0.0029</td>
      <td>0.02</td>

<p>This results is telling us that we need to restrict to very small reactivities
so that not too many false positives start appearing.</p>

<p><strong>Notice that I have not had to invoke any <em>fancy-named statistical
test</em> to do this calculation, nor have I had to make any assumptions
about the data.</strong></p>

<p>Remember that our objective is to decide on whether and how can I use
the residue reactivities to infer which residues are paired and which
aren’t. P-values refer to one single testing: <em>I look at the reactivity
of one single residue</em>. Answering the above question requires testing
all residues in the RNA structure. This is a problem of multiple
testing that we approach next.</p>

<h2 id="correcting-for-multiple-hypothesis-testing">Correcting for multiple hypothesis testing</h2>

<p>The p-values we have discussed so far give us a probability per
test. If I do my experiment one more time, and I obtain one particular
outcome, the p-value is the probability of that outcome (or another
more extreme) happening just under the null hypothesis.</p>

<p><em>How to interpret a p-value if you repeat the experiment many times?</em>
 This issue is very relevant in modern high-throughput biology. If you
 repeat a test many times, even a small p of obtaining that result
 under the null hypothesis, could results in a large number of cases
 controlled by the null hypothesis with p-value \(p\) or smaller (false positives).</p>

<p>How many false positives? approximately \(n p\), for \(n\) tests, when
you assume that all observed scores come from the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>Here is a good read about what to do with p-values for multiple
testing <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v27/n12/full/nbt1209-1135.html#f1">“How does multiple testing correction work?” by
W. Noble</a></p>

<h3 id="the-bonferroni-correction-controlling-the-familywise-error-rate">The bonferroni correction: controlling the familywise error rate</h3>

<p>A simple thing to do is, if you aim for a certain p-value \(p\) and you do \(n\) tests,
impose that for any given test you obtain a p-value of <strong>p/n</strong>. This is called
the bonferroni correction.</p>

<p>This is also called controlling the familywise error rate, as
\begin{equation}
P(\cup_i {p_i \leq p}) \leq \sum_i P(p_i\leq p/n) \leq n \frac{p}{n} = p.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>This is considered a very conservative approach for very large number or tests.</p>

<h3 id="false-discovery-rate-fdr">False Discovery Rate (FDR)</h3>

<p>Let’s go back to our problem of using chemical probing data to
estimate RNA residues that are paired into a structure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>N = number of tests (number of residues in the RNA molecule, N=265)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(sc^\ast\) a chosen score (reactivity)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(p^\ast\) p-value probability that a <em>unpaired</em> residue has a score \(sc \leq sc^\ast\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(F^\ast\) number of residues with a score \(sc \leq sc^\ast\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The False Discovery Rate is defined as <strong>the fraction of the
measurements we called positives at the p-value threshold \(p^\ast\)</strong>
(named above \(F^\ast\)), <strong>that are expected to be false positives.</strong>
That is, assuming that all \(N\) measurements are drawn from the null
hypothesis,</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mbox{FDR}         &amp;= \frac{\mbox{N} \times p^\ast}{F^\ast}.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Introducing also</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>\(T\) = Trues (residues that are paired, N=160)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(TF^\ast\) = number of T with a score \(sc \leq sc^\ast\), that is, T \(\cap\, F^\ast\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We can calculate the sensitivity corresponding to that FDR as</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mbox{Sensitivity} &amp;= \frac{TF^\ast}{T}.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>In a given experiment, you want to find a good tradeoff between the
cost of having false positive (the FDR) with the benefit of finding
more positives (the sensitivity).</p>

<p>Using the data we have, we can calculate p-values, FDR, and
sensitivity for different reactivity scores as,</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><em>reactivity</em></th>
      <th><em>p-value</em></th>
      <th><em>FDR</em></th>
      <th><em>Sensitivity (%)</em></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0.0029</td>
      <td>0.02</td>
      <td>0.17</td>
      <td>17</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.0034</td>
      <td>0.06</td>
      <td>0.34</td>
      <td>24</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.0042</td>
      <td>0.10</td>
      <td>0.45</td>
      <td>33</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.0063</td>
      <td>0.28</td>
      <td>0.67</td>
      <td>50</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Thus, in order to identify 50% of the paired bases (sensitivity), you
should expect that about 66% of the bases that you call paired are
really not paired (FDR). This is a more informative <em>and sober</em> view
of the power of chemical probing, than our original assertion about
the means of the two distribution being different with a very small
p-value.</p>

<h2 id="proper-p-value-etiquette">Proper p-value etiquette</h2>

<p>As David Mackay puts it, “[..] p-values [..] should be treated with
<em>extreme caution</em>”.  Even the American Statistical Association has
issued recent <a href="http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf">warnings on the use of
p-values</a></p>

<h3 id="what-p-values-are-not">What p-values are not</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>p-values say nothing about your beloved hypothesis. <em>Rejecting the
null hypothesis does not mean that your hypothesis is true.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>p-values are not the probability of the null model given the
data. <em>p-values tell you about the probability of the data, given the
null hypothesis.</em> A p-value of 0.01 does not mean that there is a 1%
chance for the null model to be true; rather, that you should expect a
1% false positives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>p-values are not posteriors of the null model given the data, and
cannot be used to asses model strength or to compare different
models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>p-values are often used as a measure of statistical significance,
but that is bogus.  p-values tell you about the number of false
positives that have sneaked into your experiment</em>.  In an experiment
with \(N\) observation, a p-value of \(p\) means that you should
expect find about \(N p\) false positives amongst your positives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is a small p-value significant? Remember from our <a href="../w00/w00-lecture.html#the-random-variable-f_xx-is-uniformly-distributed">w01
lectures</a>,
the \(CDF_X(X)\) is distributed uniformly. Thus, a p-value which are
values from a CDF is also distributed uniformly.</p>

    <p>If your data follows the null hypothesis, you should be as
surprised of getting a p-value of 0.05 as you would be of getting a
0.99 or any other value, because they are being drawn from a Uniform
\([0.1]\) distribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="define-precisely-your-p-value-as-a-probability-of-something">Define precisely your p-value as a probability of something</h3>

<p>When you say you are calculating a p-value, you cannot assume the
reader should know what you are talking about. And conversely, if you
read in a paper that something is “significant with a p-value of blah”
and that is all the explanation they provide, do not feel stupid if
you have no idea what they are talking about!</p>

<h3 id="specify-the-null-hypothesis">Specify the null hypothesis</h3>

<p>It is also not obvious what the null hypothesis is, that should always be specified.</p>

<h3 id="look-in-your-data-for-those-expected-false-cases">Look in your data for those expected false cases</h3>

<p>Do not use the word “significant”. All a p-value is giving you is an
idea of how many false positives you should find in your set of
predictions. It is your responsibility to estimate if that number is
reasonable or not, and to find those false predictions.  They may give
you an idea of other effects (alternative hypotheses) that you are so
far ignoring.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-p-values-of-different-experiments--dont">Comparing p-values of different experiments – don’t</h2>

<p>There is an infectious disease that if left untreated, affected people
have a probability of recovery of \(p_0 = 0.4\). We will call this the
null hypothesis \(H_0\).</p>

<p>Your lab is testing two new treatments, treatment A (<em>TrA</em>) and
treatment B (<em>TrB</em>). You run two different experiments (<em>expA</em> and
<em>expB</em>) where <em>TrA</em> or <em>TrB</em> is given to two different groups of
affected people.</p>

<p>Your analysis tells you that the p-values for the outcomes
of <em>expA</em> and <em>expB</em> respect to the null hypothesis \(H_0\) are</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mbox{pval}(expA) &amp;= 0.2131,\\
\mbox{pval}(expB) &amp;= 1.05 e^{-5}.\\
\end{aligned}\]

<p>It <em>seems</em> tempting to conclude from this results that <em>TrB</em> is a more
effective treatment than <em>TrA</em>.</p>

<p><strong>That conclusion would be wrong.</strong></p>

<p><em>You can never compare two hypotheses by looking to their p-values
relative to a third null hypothesis. There are many hidden and
possibly confounding variables in that calculation, one of them the
sample size.</em></p>

<p>Let’s see what could be going on behind the scenes. A way of obtaining
the previous result is the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>expA</em> includes 15 infected people, 8 of which recovered after using <em>TrA</em>.</li>
  <li><em>expB</em> includes 300 infected people, 157 of which recovered after using <em>TrB</em>.</li>
</ul>

<div id="figcontainer">
  <div id="figure">
    <img src="Figure_pval1.png" style="width:300px;" /> <br />
    Figure 6. Probability density under the null hypothesis and p-values for expA and expB.
  </div>
</div>

<p>The corresponding p-values, that is, the probabilities of <strong>at least</strong> 8
(157) recoveries out of 15 (300) under the null hypothesis \(H_0\) of
no treatment at all are</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mbox{pval}(expA) &amp;= \sum_{n=8}^{15}    P(n\mid N=15,  p_0) \\
&amp;= \sum_{n=8}^{15}    \frac{15!} {n! (15-n)!}  0.4^n 0.6^{15-n} \\
&amp;= 0.2131,\\
\mbox{pval}(expB) &amp;= \sum_{n=157}^{300} P(n\mid N=300, p_0) \\
&amp;= \sum_{n=157}^{300} \frac{300!}{n! (300-n)!} 0.4^n 0.6^{300-n} \\
&amp;= 1.05 e^{-5}.\\
\end{aligned}\]

<p>However, any simple analysis (for instance looking at the sample mean
for \(p_A\) and \(p_B\), the probabilities of survival under <em>TrA</em> and
<em>TrB</em>) tell you that those two treatments seem to be similar in
effectiveness,</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
p_A^* &amp;= \frac{8}{15} = 0.533,\\
p_B^* &amp;= \frac{157}{300} = 0.523.
\end{aligned}\]

<p><strong>What is going on?</strong></p>

<p>Because the sample sizes for the two experiments are
so different, the distribution \(P(n\mid N=300, H_0)\) is much
narrower than \(P(n\mid N=15, H_0)\), thus the p-value of <em>expB</em> is
smaller simply because the sample size is larger (see Figure 6).</p>

<p>If you calculate the posterior distributions \(P(p_A\mid expA)\) and
\(P(p_B\mid expB)\), which we have done before in <a href="../w02/w02-lecture.html">w02</a>,</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
P(p_A\mid expA) &amp;=   \frac{16!} {8! 7!}\,  p_A^{8} (1-p_A)^{7}\\
P(p_B\mid expB) &amp;=   \frac{301!}{157! 143!}\, p_B^{157} (1-p_B)^{143} \\
\end{aligned}\]

<p>you can conclude that your assessment of \(p_B\) is more precise than
that of \(p_A\), due to the larger amount of data, but they are
perfectly compatible with both treatments having the same
effectiveness.  (see Figure 7).</p>

<div id="figcontainer">
  <div id="figure">
    <img src="Figure_pval2.png" style="width:300px;" /> <br />
    Figure 7. Posterior probability of the efficiency of treatment A and treatment B given the
    data.
  </div>
</div>

<p>As we did in the homework of w02, you remember that when the data
follows a binomial distribution, the best estimate of the Bernoulli
parameter \(p\) and its confidence value are given by</p>

\[\begin{equation}
p^\ast  = \frac{n}{N} \quad \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{p^\ast(1-p^\ast)}{N}}.
\end{equation}\]

<p>The best estimates and confidence values for the effectiveness
of the two treatments are</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
p_A &amp;\approx 0.533 \pm 0.129\\
p_B &amp;\approx 0.523 \pm 0.029.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>In fact, if the two experiments had been run with using the same
treatment, you would have obtained one “significant” p-value and one
“non significant” p-value just because of the different sample size.</p>

<p>In each case, the p-value is telling you the right thing regarding the null hypothesis. For <em>expA</em>, you don’t have enough data to reject \(p_A=p_0=0.4\), which is the same than the posterior of \(p_A\) in Figure 7 is telling you. On the other hand, for <em>expB</em>, you have enough data to reject \(p_B=p_0=0.4\) as a likely value of the probability of recovery. The wrong statement is to use those two results to make any claims about the effectiveness of <em>TrA</em> versus <em>TrB</em>. The posterior distributions of \(p_A\) and \(p_B\) in Figure 7 are telling you a lot more (with the same data) regarding the likelihood of any possible value of the probability of recovery under each treatment.</p>

<h2 id="and-if-you-have-more-than-one-alternative-hypothesis">And if you have more than one alternative hypothesis?</h2>

<p>The Bayesian approach to the question of comparing multiple hypothesis
is clear. If you had multiple hypotheses \(H_1\ldots H_n\), one can
calculate</p>

\[P(H_i\mid D) =
\frac{P(D\mid H_i)\ P(H_i) }
{P(D\mid H_1)\ P(H_1) + \ldots + P(D\mid H_n)\ P(H_n)}, \quad 1\leq i \leq n,\]

<p>which just requires to specify some priors for the different hypotheses.</p>

<p>I am not sure how to come up with a p-value-based calculation using
more than one null hypothesis.</p>
